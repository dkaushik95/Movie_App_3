# Movie_App_3

This is the P2 of the Movie App. Because I had to move onto a tablet view, hence created a new app.

> For using the app, you must generate the MOVIEDB API Key and insert it into the code.

You can get the API Key from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

### Highlights
* This app showed the users, popular and most rated movie in a grid of its posters.
* The users could see the details by tapping the movie poster, which gave them the release date, rating, description and reviews of the movie. 
* Users could also save a movie as their favourite and later view it offline. 
* This app was a part of the Udacity course, which aimed at making the app compatible for both phones and tablets and had an appropriate view for each. 
* It used the MovieDB to retrieve all the movie details. It was refreshed with new content every time.
